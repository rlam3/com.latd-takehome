Thanks for taking the time to speak with our team! We've gotten some very positive feedback and you're a strong candidate for the position.

As I mentioned on our call, a final step in our interview process is completing a short project at your own pace. The goal is to help us understand your technical thinking and problem-solving skills.

We anticipate your submission on or before Wednesday, March 19. Let us know if you have any questions, need clarification on anything, or are unable to complete the project within that timeline.

Project Overview
We're interested in seeing how you might approach designing an AI-driven video understanding system. This type of system might attempt to capture characters, scenes, narrative, themes, activities, dialogue, and genre.

We're not looking for a complete, production-ready solution. This is just a thought exercise meant to take no more than a couple hours. It's an opportunity for us to see how you might go about tackling this type of challenge.
Challenges & Considerations
Existing multimodal models either don't support video content directly or struggle to handle it accurately, especially as content length increases. We expect capabilities to improve over time, but for this task we're interested in exploring creative workarounds or alternative approaches that could be implemented using tools and services available today.

Things to consider in your solution:

    Time-stamping video understanding data accurately.

    Supporting a variety of genres and content types, such as ads, entertainment, sports, educational content, etc.

    Handling a variety of video lengths, from 30-second ads to 2-hour movies.

    Summarizing video content across arbitrary segments of videos while maintain the context of the content as a whole.

    Supporting searches for specific visual, audio, or implied narrative elements.

    Scalability, performance, cost, and consistency.

What to Include

    High-Level System Design: Provide a summary of your approach, including the technologies and techniques you might choose. Briefly explain why these choices make sense. 

    Limitations & Solutions: Discuss how your solution would manage or overcome some of the limitations of current AI models for video understanding. Share any other concerns or considerations you might encounter while thinking through this system, even if they don't have an immediately obvious solution.

    Approach to Evaluation: Briefly explain how you'd evaluate your system, including key metrics or methods you'd consider using.

AI Assistance
Since this role is all about AI, we encourage you to use AI tools to explore your solution. Latitude embraces AI collaboration and we're eager to see how you might leverage it to enhance your thinking. If you choose to use these tools, please note where & how you used them, your thinking behind those choices, and which tools you utilized.

Submission Format
Share your submission in whatever format you think is most effective. This is primarily a thought exercise with a written deliverable. There's no length minimum/maximum. It should be as long as you feel necessary to convey your thoughts and address the task. Code isn't necessary or expected, but welcome if you think it would help to demonstrate something relevant.

We're looking forward to seeing how you might approach this!
