# AI-Driven Video Understanding System Design - Project Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the structured approach for completing the video understanding system design exercise. The plan breaks down the project into manageable phases, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all requirements.

## Execution Plan

### 1. Initial Planning Phase

- [x] Analyze the core requirements of a video understanding system
- [x] Identify specific elements to capture (characters, scenes, narrative, themes, activities, dialogue, genre)
- [x] Identify the key technical challenges highlighted in the exercise
- [x] Define the scope of our solution focusing on practical implementation with today's technology
- [x] Document initial AI tool usage and thinking process

### 2. High-Level System Design

- [x] Sketch the overall architecture approach
- [x] Select appropriate technologies and techniques available today
- [x] Define key system components and their interactions
- [x] Map the data flow through the system
- [x] Address how the system handles video ingestion and processing
- [x] Provide clear rationale for all technology choices

### 3. Addressing Specific Technical Challenges

- [x] Develop approach for accurate time-stamping of video understanding data
- [x] Design for multi-genre/content type support (ads, entertainment, sports, educational)
- [x] Create strategy for handling variable video lengths (30 seconds to 2+ hours)
- [x] Outline contextual summarization methodology for arbitrary video segments
- [x] Design search functionality for visual/audio/narrative elements
- [x] Address scalability, performance, cost, and consistency considerations

### 4. Creative Workarounds & Limitations Analysis

- [x] Identify current AI model limitations for video understanding
- [x] Propose specific creative workarounds using available tools and services
- [x] Document AI assistance used for generating workaround strategies
- [x] Discuss additional considerations or concerns without immediate solutions

### 5. Evaluation Framework

- [x] Define key metrics for system evaluation
- [x] Outline testing methodology for different aspects (accuracy, performance, etc.)
- [x] Propose quality assurance approach
- [x] Consider how to benchmark against human performance

### 6. Documentation & AI Tool Integration

- [x] Document which AI tools were used throughout the solution development
- [x] Explain reasoning behind specific AI tool choices for each component
- [x] Highlight how AI tools enhanced the solution process
- [x] Reflect on the collaboration process with AI

### 7. Final Documentation

- [x] Structure the final submission for maximum clarity
- [x] Ensure the three main deliverables are comprehensively addressed:
  - High-Level System Design
  - Limitations & Solutions
  - Approach to Evaluation
- [x] Review for clarity, completeness and technical soundness
