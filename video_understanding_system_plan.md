# AI-Driven Video Understanding System Design - Project Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the structured approach for completing the video understanding system design exercise. The plan breaks down the project into manageable phases, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all requirements.

## Execution Plan

### 1. Initial Planning Phase

- [ ] Analyze the core requirements of a video understanding system
- [ ] Identify specific elements to capture (characters, scenes, narrative, themes, activities, dialogue, genre)
- [ ] Identify the key technical challenges highlighted in the exercise
- [ ] Define the scope of our solution focusing on practical implementation with today's technology
- [ ] Document initial AI tool usage and thinking process

### 2. High-Level System Design

- [ ] Sketch the overall architecture approach
- [ ] Select appropriate technologies and techniques available today
- [ ] Define key system components and their interactions
- [ ] Map the data flow through the system
- [ ] Address how the system handles video ingestion and processing
- [ ] Provide clear rationale for all technology choices

### 3. Addressing Specific Technical Challenges

- [ ] Develop approach for accurate time-stamping of video understanding data
- [ ] Design for multi-genre/content type support (ads, entertainment, sports, educational)
- [ ] Create strategy for handling variable video lengths (30 seconds to 2+ hours)
- [ ] Outline contextual summarization methodology for arbitrary video segments
- [ ] Design search functionality for visual/audio/narrative elements
- [ ] Address scalability, performance, cost, and consistency considerations

### 4. Creative Workarounds & Limitations Analysis

- [ ] Identify current AI model limitations for video understanding
- [ ] Propose specific creative workarounds using available tools and services
- [ ] Document AI assistance used for generating workaround strategies
- [ ] Discuss additional considerations or concerns without immediate solutions

### 5. Evaluation Framework

- [ ] Define key metrics for system evaluation
- [ ] Outline testing methodology for different aspects (accuracy, performance, etc.)
- [ ] Propose quality assurance approach
- [ ] Consider how to benchmark against human performance

### 6. Documentation & AI Tool Integration

- [ ] Document which AI tools were used throughout the solution development
- [ ] Explain reasoning behind specific AI tool choices for each component
- [ ] Highlight how AI tools enhanced the solution process
- [ ] Reflect on the collaboration process with AI

### 7. Final Documentation

- [ ] Structure the final submission for maximum clarity
- [ ] Ensure the three main deliverables are comprehensively addressed:
  - High-Level System Design
  - Limitations & Solutions
  - Approach to Evaluation
- [ ] Review for clarity, completeness and technical soundness

## Timeline

- Initial planning and analysis: March 15
- System design and technical approaches: March 16-17
- Evaluation framework and documentation: March 18
- Final review and submission: March 19
